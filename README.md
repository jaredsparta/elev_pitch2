Hi I'm Jared,

I recently graduated this year with a bachelor's in Maths. During my time at university I grew more and more passionate about
the tech industry and the one thing that led me to devops consulting was how flexible a skill set it would allow me to
develop. I have always aimed to be well rounded in my development and a career where I could practice both technical
and soft skills is something I find highly desirable. Not only this, but I have always been someone who looked to 
constantly learn new skills and a career in such a highly evolving and cutting edge industry would allow me to do 
that too.

More specifically about my choosing to be a consultant: I have experience tutoring at university and I have always
took pride in my ability to help and teach others -- most recently I tutored a first year engineering student with
his upcoming exams, which he passed first time. So, all in all, it's really the experiences that I found most
rewarding that led me to transition to a career in DevOps.

Hi I'm Jared,

I graduated earlier this year with a Bachelor's in Maths from Warwick. In my final year I took a module on data science which sparked a deep interest in the tech industry. The overwhelming reason I was attracted to DevOps consulting was the fact that I could not only develop technical skills but the softer skills too. As someone who strives to accomplish a lot, I felt this was highly desirable to me. The opportunity to work in such an innovative role in a highly-evolving industry is something I find extremely enticing.

Specifically about my choice to move into a consulting role, I have always been passionate about using my knowledge to aid others -- most recently I accomplished quite a lot with one of my tutees. He was a first year engineering student who was struggling with his upcoming exams and through my detail-oriented approach to teaching he was able to pass them first time. So to sum up, I would say it was really my fulfilling experiences that led me to this point.
