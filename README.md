Hi I'm Jared,

I recently graduated this year with a bachelor's in Maths. During my time at university I grew more and more passionate about
the tech industry and the one thing that led me to devops consulting was how flexible a skill set it would allow me to
develop. I have always aimed to be well rounded in my development and a career where I could practice both technical
and soft skills is something I find highly desirable. Not only this, but I have always been someone who looked to 
constantly learn new skills and a career in such a highly evolving and cutting edge industry would allow me to do 
that too.

More specifically about my choosing to be a consultant: I have experience tutoring at university and I have always
took pride in my ability to help and teach others -- most recently I tutored a first year engineering student with
his upcoming exams, which he passed first time. So, all in all, it's really the experiences that I found most
rewarding that led me to transition to a career in DevOps.

FEEDBACK:
- More passionate in the delivery
- Stutter less
- Give yourself a few pauses
